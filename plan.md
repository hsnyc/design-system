## Scope & Goals:

Target audience: internal teams, solo developer.

Essential features: component documentation, live previews, code snippets, design guidelines (colors, typography, spacing), search, responsiveness.

Goal: Create a reusable template/starter kit for documenting design systems.

## Choose Technology Stack:

Framework/SSG: None, just use plain HTML, CSS, and Js. I don’t want any build steps.

Documentation Format: Use MDX (Markdown with JSX/Components) to allow writing documentation alongside interactive component examples.

Styling: Plain CSS using variables

Version Control: Use Git and host on a platform like GitHub for collaboration and sharing.

## Set Up Project Structure:

Create a clear directory structure:

components: Individual UI components (source, styles, docs, tests).

`/pages` or `/docs`: MDX files for documentation pages (organized by component, guidelines, etc.).

`/styles`: Global styles, design tokens (variables for colors, fonts, spacing).

`/layouts`: Website layout components.

`/public`: Static assets (images, fonts).

`/lib` or `/utils`: Helper functions or shared logic.

Initialize Git repository.

Set up package manager (npm or yarn) and install initial dependencies.

## Develop Core Website Structure:

Implement basic website layout (header, sidebar navigation, main content area).

Set up routing based on static site structure.

Integrate MDX processing to render documentation pages.

## Component Implementation & Documentation:

Develop a few core UI components (e.g., Button, Card, Input) as examples.

For each component:

Write the component code.

Write associated styles.

Create an MDX file in the documentation directory.

In the MDX file: describe the component, provide usage examples (importing and using the component directly), list its props/API, show code snippets.

Implement features for live previews and code snippet display within MDX.

## Design Guidelines Documentation:

Create MDX pages for documenting core design principles:

Color palette (displaying swatches and variable names).

Typography (showcasing font families, sizes, weights).

Spacing system.

Iconography.

Other relevant guidelines.
